# Genre Predictor

This is a machine learning project built with Python that predicts music genre preferences based on age and gender. The program reads a CSV file that contains data on age, gender, and genres liked by the user, where 0 represents female and 1 represents male. The program trains a machine learning model and outputs the accuracy rate of the model.
