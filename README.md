# Python Salad

Welcome to the Python Salad repository! This is a collection of projects that I have been working on while learning programming.

## Projects

Here are the projects currently included in this repository:

-Impression Predictor:
Impression Predictor is a Machine Learning program that predicts the number of clicks and impressions for a given query. The program uses Linear Regression to learn the relationship between the queries and their corresponding clicks and impressions, based on a dataset of past queries and their click and impression counts.

-Genre Predictor:
This is a machine learning project built with Python that predicts music genre preferences based on age and gender. The program reads a CSV file that contains data on age, gender, and genres liked by the user, where 0 represents female and 1 represents male. The program trains a machine learning model and outputs the accuracy rate of the model.

-password-manager:
Application to store and retrive passwords with encryption capabilities

-Word Cloud: 
This project generates a word cloud using the text from a given file. 
It uses the wordcloud library to generate a visually appealing word cloud. 

-Bill Amount Generator.py: 
This project calculates the total bill amount based on the price and quantity of items purchased. 
The user inputs the item name, price, and quantity and the program calculates the total bill amount. 
It also calculates discounted Price. This program has a logic that determines if the customer is eligible for the discount or not, 
based on the criteria given. 

-Guess The Number.py: 
This project generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number. 
If the user's guess is correct, the program prints a message saying "Congratulations, you guessed the number!". 
If the user's guess is incorrect, the program tells the user whether the guess is too high or too low and prompts the user to guess again. 

-PasswordGenerator.py: 
This project generates a random password of a specified length. 
The password can include upper and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. 

-PlotTwoPoints.py: 
This project plots two points on a 2D coordinate plane. It uses the matplotlib library to plot the points. 

-RockPaperScissors.py: 
This project allows the user to play a game of rock-paper-scissors against the computer. 
The program randomly selects either rock, paper, or scissors as the computer's choice and prompts the user to select. 
The program then determines the winner based on the rules of the game. 

-Temperature Converter.py: 
This project converts temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit. 
The user inputs the temperature in either Celsius or Fahrenheit and the program converts it to the other unit. 

-Water Drink Reminder.py: 
This project reminds the user to drink water at regular intervals throughout the day.  

-TextToSpeech.py:
This is a basic Python program that converts text input into speech output on a MacOS system using the built-in 'say' command. The user is prompted to enter the text they wish to convert, and the program will continue to run until the user enters "QUIT" to exit. It is a simple and straightforward tool that can be useful for anyone who needs a quick text-to-speech conversion on their Mac.

-QRGenerator.py:
This code will convert the given URL into a QR Code. 

-Todo_list.py:
This code accompained by MySQL script will create a use database to systematically store ToDo list with CRUD interface

-Pattern Probles:
This file includes a collection of programming challenges related to pattern printing.

-Online Banking System.py:
Consists of several classes representing users, accounts, transactions, and the overall banking system. The system allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, view account details, and check transaction history.

-WebScraper.ipynb:
Scrap URLs from a dynamic websites.

-PDF_Generator.ipynb:
Create PDF files with custom content.

-Vehicle Managent System (HTML/CSS/ JS):
Easily add and list your vehicle with simple steps.
